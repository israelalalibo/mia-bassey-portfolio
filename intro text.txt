Allow me (re)introduce myself ✨

My name is Mia Bassey - Certified Stretch & Flexibility Coach, with a BSc degree in Biochemistry, and currently pursuing my MSc in Project Management.

My journey has been one of movement and growth. From Lagos - Uyo - back to Lagos for my NYSC - and now the United Kingdom for my Master’s degree. Every step has been a search for the life I envisioned — one where I could create something meaningful, inspire others, and leave my mark.

Now, I’m in a new country, a new environment, with the same dreams but even bigger goals. This chapter is about building, evolving, and sharing the gift of movement, flexibility, and strength with those ready to unlock their fullest potential.

Here’s to new beginnings 🥂 🌍✨

Your Flexibility Coach,
Mia🌸🧘🏽‍♀️✨
